                    <p>"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."</br> - Viktor Frankl, <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i></p>

                    <p>"Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is to not stop questioning."</br> - Albert Einstein 

                    <p>"The ability to control impulse is the base of will and character. By the same token, the root of altruism lies in empathy, the ability to read emotions in others; lacking a sense of another's need or despair, there is no caring." </br> - Daniel Goleman, <i>Emotional Intelligence</i></p>


                    <p>"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." </br> - Dr. Seuss</p>

                    <p>"Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere."</br> - Frank Herbert</p>

                    <p>"All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once they grow up." </br> - John Wooden</p>

                    <p>"Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful." </br> - Pablo Picasso</p>


                    <p>"For in everything it is no easy task to find the middle, e.g. to find the middle of a circle is not for every one but for him who knows; so, too, any one can get angry—that is easy—or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way, that is not for every one, nor is it easy..." 
                    </br> - Aristotle, <i>The Nicomachean Ethics</i> </p>

                    <p>"The most important investment you can make is in yourself."</br> - Warren Buffett</p>

                    <p>"Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile." </br> - Albert Einstein </p>

                    <p>"Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people." </br> - Socrates</p>

                    <p>"Ex nihilo nihil fit." </br> <i>Nothing comes from nothing. </i> 
                    </br> - Parmenides</p>

                    <p>"Expect problems and eat them for breakfast."</br> - Alfred A. Montapert</p>

                    <p>"Never permit a dichotomy to rule your life, a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so that you can have pleasure in your spare time. Look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time." </br> - Pablo Picasso</p>

                    <p>"It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested. But when it is squandered in luxury and carelessness, when it is devoted to no good end, forced at last by the ultimate necessity we perceive that it has passed away before we were aware that it was passing. So it is—the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it. Just as great and princely wealth is scattered in a moment when it comes into the hands of a bad owner, while wealth however limited, if it is entrusted to a good guardian, increases by use, so our life is amply long for him who orders it properly." </br> - Seneca</p>

                    <p>"For by wise counsel you can wage your war, and in an abundance of counselors there is victory and safety." </br> - Proverbs 24:6</p>

                    <p>"Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people." </br> - Chief Tecumseh (Shawnee tribe)</p>

                    

                    <p>"Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist."</br> - Pablo Picasso</p>

                    <p>"I saw that to accomplish anything I must bring all physical and moral faculties into play, exercise strict self-control and play the chameleon."</br> - Ian Kelly, <i>Casanova</i></p>


                    <p>"Chance favors the prepared mind." </br> - Louis Pasteur</p>

                    <p>"Si vis amari, ama."</br> <i>If you wish to be loved, love.</i> </br> - Seneca </p>

                    <p>"One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself." </br>- Leonardo da Vinci</p>

                    <p>"Outstanding leaders go out of their way to boost the self-esteem of their personnel. If people believe in themselves, it's amazing what they can accomplish." </br> - Sam Walton</p>

                    <p>"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart." s</br> - Steve Jobs</p>

                    <p>"One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil." </br> - Friedrich Nietzsche</p>

                    <p>"Be so busy improving yourself that you have no time to criticize others." </br> - Chetan Bhagat</p>

                    <p>"Strong opinions, weakly held." </br> - Bob Sutton</p>

                    <p>"The best people possess a feeling for beauty, the courage to take risks, the discipline to tell the truth, the capacity for sacrifice. Ironically, their virtues make them vulnerable; they are often wounded, sometimes destroyed." </br> - Ernest Hemingway </p>

                    <p>"We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infinitesimal hairline between an all-powerfully causative past and an absorbingly important future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of touch with reality. We confuse the world as talked about, described, and measured with the world which actually is. We are sick with a fascination for the useful tools of names and numbers, of symbols, signs, conceptions and ideas." </br> - Alan Watts</p>

                    <p>"Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn’t mean politics won’t take an interest in you.” </br> - Pericles</p>

                    <p>"Live a good life. If there are Gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are Gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no Gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." </br> - Marcus Aurelius</p>

                    <p>"A man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green." </br> - Francis Bacon</p>

                    <p>"Missing out on some opportunity never bothers us. What’s wrong with someone getting a little richer than you? Someone will always be getting richer faster than you. It’s crazy to worry about this. This is not a tragedy." </br> - Charlie Munger</p>

                    <p>"Survival machines that can simulate the future are one jump ahead of survival machines who can only learn on the basis of overt trial and error. The trouble with overt trial is that is takes time and energy. The trouble with overt error is that it is often fatal. Simulation is both safer and faster. The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness." </br> - Richard Dawkins, <i>The Selfish Gene</i></p>

                    <p>"Life as we find it is too hard for us; it brings too many pains, disappointments and impossible tasks. In order to bear it we cannot dispense with palliative measures… There are perhaps three such measures: powerful deflections, which cause us to make light of our misery; substitute satisfactions, which diminish it; and intoxicating substances, which make us insensible to it." </br> - Sigmund Freud <i>Civilization and its Discontents</i></p>

                    <p>"To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people." </br> - Charlie Munger </p>

                    <p>"Sweat is the cologne of accomplishment." </br> - Heywood Hale Broun</p>

                    <p>"People who read Cosmopolitan magazine are very different from those who do not." </br> - Donald Berry, <i>Statistics: A Bayesian Perspective</i></p>

                    <p>"A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds" </br> - Ted Nelson</p>


                    <p>"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." </br> - Hal Abelson &#38 Jerry Sussman, <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i></p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p> -->
